# Yuco Chimney Ebay Interface

This application is built on Meteor.js in order to provide a web interface for Yuco Chimney Supply's Ebay
listings. This allows for easier updating of product quantities and product quantities, as well as immediate
emailing and storing of shipping information into a mongo database. The goal of this application is to expose
the Ebay interface for a single ebay account, but could potentially be expanded to allow for any user to enter
their Ebay details and create a streamlined online marketplace management system.
